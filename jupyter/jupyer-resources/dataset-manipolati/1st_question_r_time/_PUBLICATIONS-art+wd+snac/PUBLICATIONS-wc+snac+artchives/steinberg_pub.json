It brings in a host of confirming images; deepens the theological argument; and answers skeptical or scandalized critics who decried the book at its first publication. In its polemical parts, the book wrestles large issues, such as the validity of interpretations that come without supporting texts, or the modern pleas that the maleness of Christ be tempered into androgyny. Along the way, the topics engaged range from Christ's human nature to Dr. Strangelove, from St. Augustine's dismal assessment of babyhood to the aesthetics of the U.S. Post Office.\"--Jacket",

      "summary": "Critical essays on the artist Robert Rauschenberg, focusing on the important period of his development in the 1950s and 1960s.From the moment art historian Leo Steinberg championed his work in opposition to Clement Greenberg's rigid formalism, Robert Rauschenberg has played a pivotal role in the development and understanding of postmodern art. Challenging nearly all the prevailing assumptions about the visual arts of his time, he pioneered the postwar revival of collage, photography, silkscreen, technology, and performance.This book focuses on Rauschenberg's work during the critical period of the 1950s and 1960s. It opens with a newly prefaced version of Leo Steinberg's \"Reflections on the State of Criticism,\" the first published version of his famous 1972 essay, \"Other Criteria,\" which remains the single most important text on Rauschenberg. Rosalind Krauss's \"Rauschenberg and the Materialized Image\" builds on Steinberg's essay, arguing that Rauschenberg's work represents a decisive shift in contemporary art. Douglas Crimp's \"On the Museum's Ruins\" examines Rauschenberg's silkscreens in the context of the modern museum. Helen Molesworth's \"Before Bed\" uses psychoanalytic and economic structures to examine the artist's Black Paintings of the early 1950s. A second essay by Krauss, \"Perpetual Inventory,\" revisits both her and Steinberg's articles of nearly twenty-five years earlier. Finally, Branden Joseph's \"A Duplication Containing Duplications\" views Rauschenberg's silkscreens in relation to the artist's interests in technology, particularly television",

      "summary": "\"A picture universally recognized, endlessly scrutinized and described, incessantly copied, adapted, lampooned: does Leonardo's near-ruined Last Supper still offer anything new to be seen or to be said: This book is a resounding Yes to both questions. With direct perception - and with attention paid to the work of earlier scholars and to the criticism embodied in the production of copyists over the past five hundred years - Steinberg demonstrates that Leonardo's mural has been consistently over-simplified. This most thought-out picture in Western art, painted in the 1490s on the north wall of the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan, is a marvel of compressed meanings. Its subject is not one arrested moment, but successiveness and duration. It is not only Christ's announcement of the forthcoming betrayal, but in equal measure the institution of the eucharist. More than the spur of the moment animates the disciples, and more than perspective determines their housing. Though Leonardo's geometry obeys all the rules, it responds as well to Christ's action at center, as if in emanation from the prime mover. The picture is simultaneously narrative and sacramental. As its protagonist is two-natured, as the twofold event of this night is both human submission and divine dispensation - so the entire picture is shown to have been conceived in duplexity: a sublime pun.\" \"Meanwhile, the unending disagreement as to what exactly is represented, what the depicted actions express, how and where this assembly is seated - all these still raging disputes are traced to a single mistaken assumption: that Leonardo intended throughout to be unambiguous and clear, and that any one meaning necessarily rules out every other.\" \"As Steinberg reveals an abundance of significant interrelations previously overlooked, Leonardo's masterpiece regains the freshness of its initial conception and the power to fascinate.\"--Jacket",

This volume collects Steinberg's best essays and unpublished lectures about early modern artists and sites ranging from his superb, ground-shifting texts on the Spanish painter Diego Velazquez to an amusing essay on his visit to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome, which houses artistic treasures by such luminaries as Bramante, Sansovino, Raphael, Pinturicchio, Sebastiano del Piombo, Carracci, Caravaggio, and Bernini. The other essays are, with one or two exceptions, mainly about Italian masters. The content is quite diverse, and perhaps for this reason this volume is the most pleasurable so far. Steinberg exercises his wit to good effect, and these essays, though frequently dazzling with insight, read as rather more lightly composed than those surrounding Steinberg's grand obsession, Michelangelo\"--",

      "summary": "In his insightful and engrossing lecture, Leo Steinberg surveys and critiques the work of Robert Rauschenberg, one of the great American post-war artists. He also discusses his own experience as a critic in the exciting and turbulent art world of New York in the 1950s and 1960s. The result is a rare glimpse not only into Rauschenberg, but also into Steinberg.With the sharpness and confidence that can only come from a critic who has long been involved with Rauschenberg's work, Steinberg offers an in-depth discussion of such major pieces as the Erased DeKooning Drawing, Bed, and Monogram. He explains the subtle differences between his interpretations and those of other critics, such as Clement Greenberg and Hilton Kramer. He candidly reflects on how he has changed his mind over the years, and defends his new ideas about Rauschenberg's work with precise, fresh arguments. He critically evaluates Rauschenberg's more recent work and addresses how it falls short from the artist's earlier work.From Rauschenberg's silk-screen prints of the 1960s to the vegetable dye transfer prints of the 1990s, Steinberg warns against the dangers of overinterpretation and iconographic enthusiasm. He argues that the unifying strand through this great artist's work is his drive to appropriate, to take objects and images from the world and make them his own by making them become a part of his art.Provocative, intelligent, and beautifully articulated, Steinberg's words shed light on one remarkable artist and on the post-war New York art scene, on Steinberg's particular appreciation of Rauschenberg and on his life's work as an art critic",
