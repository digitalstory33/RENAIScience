The correspondence with museums, individual clients and suppliers and experts comprise the greater part of the collection. Photographs of art works, financial papers, research and publicity files, and Andrew Ciechanowiecki's personal business files make up the rest of the archive. The correspondence series contains letters received and the gallery's copies of letters sent. Letters reflect the gallery's offers to museums and individual collectors, curators' requests for works for their collections or for assistance in finding works needed for exhibitions. The letters also document business strategies and Ciechanowiecki's collaborations with museums and his solid scholarly contributions to exhibitions. The letters also reveal his close personal association with Poland and its artistic patrimony. A separate group of correspondence concerns the sale of the Heim Gallery. There are no personal papers in the archive. Photographs of art works are organized by medium: paintings, drawings, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts, and represent works sold, with additional images of items before restoration, and art works documented for research or commercial reasons. Research notes, printed brochures, and photographs illustrate the production of exhibitions at the Heim Gallery. Research files contain notes, numerous study photographs, and some printed matter, organized by artist, school or medium. Many research files represent works offered to the gallery but rejected. Financial records include stockbooks, ledgers and cash books, as well as invoices, paid bills, and documents related to shipping and taxes. Financial records do not appear to be complete. Gallery publicity is documented through clippings, guest books, and photographs that show members of royalty attending exhibits at the gallery. ",

The collection documents Keller's academic and scholarly career and provides a view of art history scholarship and pedagogy during a formative period in the discipline. Extensive, carefully composed and detailed course and lecture notes provide a precise record of Keller's teaching methods and illustrate his generalist approach. Topics cover painting, sculpture, architecture, and urbanism from the Early Christian and Byzantine periods through Impressionism. His scholarship and teaching are further documented in research notes and manuscripts, as well as in correspondence with other art historians. The body of letters from Richard Krautheimer is particularly significant (50 items, 1943-1989); other correspondents include: Christoph Liutpold Frommel (11 letters), Hans Sedlmayr, Ludwig H. Heydenreich, Theodor Mu\u0308ller, Ulrich Middeldorf, Rudolf Wittkower. Manuscripts in the collection comprise material for published and unpublished books, articles, essays, Festschriften, and memorial orations, together with notes and letters referring to these works. Topics addressed in the manuscripts include: Baroque staircases (Keller's dissertation); Renaissance landscape; Italian Gothic sculpture; urbanism in Italy, Central Europe and the Baltic countries; the history of portraiture; and history and fiction; also 27 ms. pages of an autobiography written in 1967.

      "abstract": "The Heim Gallery records document the business of the gallery, its cultivation of clients in Europe and the United States, and the production of its scholarly exhibitions especially for the period between 1966 and 1988. The correspondence with museums, individual clients and suppliers and experts comprise the greater part of the collection. Photographs of art works, financial papers, research and publicity files, and Andrew Ciechanowiecki's personal business files make up the rest of the archive. The correspondence series contains letters received and the gallery's copies of letters sent. Letters reflect the gallery's offers to museums and individual collectors, curators' requests for works for their collections or for assistance in finding works needed for exhibitions. The letters also document business strategies and Ciechanowiecki's collaborations with museums and his solid scholarly contributions to exhibitions. The letters also reveal his close personal association with Poland and its artistic patrimony. A separate group of correspondence concerns the sale of the Heim Gallery. There are no personal papers in the archive. Photographs of art works are organized by medium: paintings, drawings, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts, and represent works sold, with additional images of items before restoration, and art works documented for research or commercial reasons. Research notes, printed brochures, and photographs illustrate the production of exhibitions at the Heim Gallery. Research files contain notes, numerous study photographs, and some printed matter, organized by artist, school or medium. Many research files represent works offered to the gallery but rejected. Financial records include stockbooks, ledgers and cash books, as well as invoices, paid bills, and documents related to shipping and taxes. Financial records do not appear to be complete. Gallery publicity is documented through clippings, guest books, and photographs that show members of royalty attending exhibits at the gallery. ",

The collection documents Keller's academic and scholarly career and provides a view of art history scholarship and pedagogy during a formative period in the discipline. Extensive, carefully composed and detailed course and lecture notes provide a precise record of Keller's teaching methods and illustrate his generalist approach. Topics cover painting, sculpture, architecture, and urbanism from the Early Christian and Byzantine periods through Impressionism. His scholarship and teaching are further documented in research notes and manuscripts, as well as in correspondence with other art historians. The body of letters from Richard Krautheimer is particularly significant (50 items, 1943-1989); other correspondents include: Christoph Liutpold Frommel (11 letters), Hans Sedlmayr, Ludwig H. Heydenreich, Theodor Mueller, Ulrich Middeldorf, Rudolf Wittkower. Manuscripts in the collection comprise material for published and unpublished books, articles, essays, Festschriften, and memorial orations, together with notes and letters referring to these works. Topics addressed in the manuscripts include: Baroque staircases (Keller's dissertation); Renaissance landscape; Italian Gothic sculpture; urbanism in Italy, Central Europe and the Baltic countries; the history of portraiture; and history and fiction; also 27 ms. pages of an autobiography written in 1967.
