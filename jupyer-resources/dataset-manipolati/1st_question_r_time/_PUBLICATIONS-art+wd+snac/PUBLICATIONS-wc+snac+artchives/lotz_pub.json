      "summary": "Moving between the various centres of architectural activity throughout Italy, Wolfgang Lotz discusses with authority the work of such well-known architects as Bramante, Giulio Romano, Michelangelo and Palladio. He focuses on the different schemes for St Peter's in Rome, the projects connected with the church of S. Lorenzo in Florence and the churches and villas designed by Palladio in and around Venice. And yet Lotz also goes beyond the more familiar locations, architects and buildings to conquer less well-known territories, exploring Piedmont and Vitozzi and ending with a study of bizzarrie. Lotz's distinguished and highly readable text is now reissued accompanied by a wide range of beautiful illustrations and a critical introduction and updated bibliography by Deborah Howard. Dr Howard assesses Lotz's standing as an architectural historian, and surveys the developments in the discipline and the new material published since the first edition",

      "abstract": "The Leo Steinberg Research Papers consist of research notes, correspondence relating to his lectures and essays, papers written by his students, several versions of some of his essays, an abandoned dissertation project, and many of his notebooks from courses he took at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. The archive reflects Steinberg's career as an art critic, lecturer and teacher from ca. 1945-ca.1996. The research notes and course notebooks give a clear picture of Steinberg's fields of interest, as well as his association with many distinguished art historians. Included are Steinberg's unpublished research on Borromini, his work on Rodin and Titian in the form of notes, photographs, lectures in typescript with notes; a few essays by others; his dissertation on Borromini, and professional correspondence such as with Rudolf Wittkower about Borromini. Correspondence about Steinberg's lecture series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and elsewhere includes letters from scholars such as Gerson Cohen, Rene d'Harnoncourt, John Canaday, Margaret Scolari Barr, Andre\u0301 Chastel, Julius Held, H.S. Janson, Irving Lavin, Annette Michelson and Phil Leider. Also, there is correspondence with art critic Hilton Kramer about Steinberg's column in the magazine Arts; articles and letters about his essay on Jasper Johns and lecture \"Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion,\" and reviews and versions of several essays from Steinberg's book Other criteria. The Papers also contain research notes, illustrations and several chapters for his abandoned dissertation \"Afterlife of Romanesque.\" Includes notebooks, many with photographs and illustrations, for courses Steinberg took when he attended the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU from 1950-1963. Professors include Harry Bober, Robert Goldwater, Ernst Kitzinger, Richard Krautheimer, Karl Lehmann, Wolfgang Lotz, Bates Lowry, Erwin Panofsky, Alfred Salmony, Charles Sterling and Herbert Weissberger.
