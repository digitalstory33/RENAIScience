      "summary": "\"Here John Pope-Hennessy takes as his subject two centuries of experiment in portraiture during the Renaissance. He shows how the Renaissance cult of individuality brought with it a demand that the features of the individual be perpetuated. This concept was first manifested in the portraits that fill the great Florentine fresco cycles and led, later in the fifteenth century, to the creation of the independent portrait by such artists as Botticelli, Antonio Pollaiuolo, Giovanni Bellini, and Antonello da Messina. The author goes on to describe the process by which Titian and the great artists of the High Renaissance transformed the portrait from a record of appearance into an analysis of character.\"--Amazon",

      "summary": "\u00ab The great period of western European culture that begins with the Renaissance about 1400 and ends with the Rococo about 1780 can truly be called \"The Golden Age\" of figurative art, and especially of sculpture. Never have sculptors risen to higher levels of achievement, nor has their influence been more widely felt. During the Middle Ages sculptors were concerned with illustrating and expounding the concepts of Christianity. In the modern era they have devoted themselves to secular subjects. But in the centuries between, from the fifteenth century to the French Revolution, artists had to be masters of both religious and secular art, and be prepared to represent Classical concepts side by side, and even to intermingle the two in their works. Donatello, Michelangelo and Bernini, Pilon and Girardon, Berruguete and Cano, Schlu\u0308ter and Gu\u0308nther, Duquesnoy, Gibbons, and Roubilliac are some of the famous sculptors of the period ; around them were gathered a great many others who successfully fulfilled an unparalleled variety of creative tasks. The attempt to achieve a balance between the rediscovered world of nature and antiquity on the one hand, and Christian tradition on the other, created stresses which enriched their artistic endeavours and stimulated the evolution of new techniques and forms\u2009\u2013\u2009new forms that are classified today as Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo. In a sound text and with a wealth of illustrations, the author vividly portrays the richness of this distinctive Western period and provides new insight into the special problems which confronted the sculptors of this era. \u00bb--",

      "summary": "In recent years many of Donatello's sculptures have been transformed by cleaning. As a result, the Donatello we see now is a different Donatello from the one discussed by earlier scholars. In this book cleaned sculptures are reproduced in their cleaned state. The once neglected stucco reliefs in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo radiate the majesty and the vividness they possessed in the fifteenth century. The Coscia monument in the Baptistry in Florence shines with its original gilt, and the great St. Mark from Or San Michele has reassumed its lifelike character. Donatello's wooden sculptures - the Baptist in Venice and the Magdalen in Florence - are presented here freed from the overpaint which previously covered them. This book will remain the standard work on Donatello for many years to come",

The correspondence with museums, individual clients and suppliers and experts comprise the greater part of the collection. Photographs of art works, financial papers, research and publicity files, and Andrew Ciechanowiecki's personal business files make up the rest of the archive. The correspondence series contains letters received and the gallery's copies of letters sent. Letters reflect the gallery's offers to museums and individual collectors, curators' requests for works for their collections or for assistance in finding works needed for exhibitions. The letters also document business strategies and Ciechanowiecki's collaborations with museums and his solid scholarly contributions to exhibitions. The letters also reveal his close personal association with Poland and its artistic patrimony. A separate group of correspondence concerns the sale of the Heim Gallery. There are no personal papers in the archive. Photographs of art works are organized by medium: paintings, drawings, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts, and represent works sold, with additional images of items before restoration, and art works documented for research or commercial reasons. Research notes, printed brochures, and photographs illustrate the production of exhibitions at the Heim Gallery. Research files contain notes, numerous study photographs, and some printed matter, organized by artist, school or medium. Many research files represent works offered to the gallery but rejected. Financial records include stockbooks, ledgers and cash books, as well as invoices, paid bills, and documents related to shipping and taxes. Financial records do not appear to be complete. Gallery publicity is documented through clippings, guest books, and photographs that show members of royalty attending exhibits at the gallery. ",
