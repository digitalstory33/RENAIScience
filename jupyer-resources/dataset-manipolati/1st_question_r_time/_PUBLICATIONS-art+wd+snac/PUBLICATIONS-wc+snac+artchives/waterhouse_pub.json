      "summary": "\"The field covered by this volume includes the work and influence of foreign-born painters such as Holbein and Van Dyck as well as native masters from Gower and Hilliard to Gainsborough, Stubbs, and Sandby. We can follow step by step the development and flowering of British painting, and can compare, for example, the work of the English Sir Joshua Reynolds with the Scottish Allan Ramsay. Portrait and landscape, history piece, miniature, water colour, there is a record of them all. The text is both scholarly and eminently readable and the illustrations comprise well known examples of British painting and others seldom or never before reproduced between the covers of a book. This new edition includes an introductory essay by Michael Kitson bringing readers up-to-date with the latest approaches to the period, as well as colour plates and a revised bibliography.\"--Jacket",

During this nascent phase of the museum the Director's Office handled almost all aspects of business and consequently these files reflect a wide spectrum of museum concerns including publicity, acquisitions, finances, staff hiring, construction, and expansion of the museum. Some files are devoted to individuals and institutions while others are labelled with subjects such as Inquiries, Acquisitions, and Employment. The subject headings and content of the materials remains quite consistent throughout the years, even through the tenures of different Directors. ",
