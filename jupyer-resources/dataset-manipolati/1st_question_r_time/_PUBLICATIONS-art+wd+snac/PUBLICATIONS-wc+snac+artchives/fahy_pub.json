Volume V completes the series, Volumes I and II having been devoted to furniture and gilt bronze; Volumes III and IV to snuffboxes, silver, porcelain, and other objects of decorative art. An introduction by John Walker, Director Emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., gives a fascinating history of the way in which the Wrightsman Collection has been built up and refined; Sir John Pope-Hennessy, Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, provides an authoritative introduction to the sculpture section. Each entry includes a large-size illustration of the object (all the paintings are in full color) as well as many detailed views and comparable examples; the text is made up of a biography of the artist, physical description, provenance, and scholarly discussion, as well as a listing of other versions, exhibitions, references, and technical notes",

      "summary": "\"Many famous artworks of the Italian Renaissance were made to celebrate love, marriage, and family. They were the pinnacles of a tradition, dating from early in the era, of commemorating betrothals, marriages, and the birth of children by commissioning extraordinary objects - maiolica, glassware, jewels, textiles, paintings - that were often also exchanged as gifts. This volume is the first comprehensive survey of artworks arising from Renaissance rituals of love and marriage and makes a major contribution to our understanding of Renaissance art in its broader cultural context. The impressive range of works gathered in these pages extends from birth trays painted in the early fifteenth century to large canvases on mythological themes that Titian painted in the mid-1500s. Each work of art would have been recognized by contemporary viewers for its prescribed function within the private, domestic domain.\"--BOOK JACKET",
