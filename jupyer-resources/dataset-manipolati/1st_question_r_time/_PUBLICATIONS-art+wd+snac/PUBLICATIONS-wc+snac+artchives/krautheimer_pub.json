Lavishly illustrated, this book tells an intriguing story in which the heritage of antiquity intertwines with the living presence of Christianity. Written by one of the great art historians of our time, it offers a profile of the Eternal City unlike any drawn in the past or likely to be drawn in the future.\"--Amazon",

To recount the story of Ghiberti's double achievement, the North as well as the East Door, Richard Krautheimer has extracted the whole wealth of illustrations for the doors: every panel is shown, some in detail, with close-ups of the portrait busts and the plant and animal vignettes that enliven the borders. Four color plates recapture the shimmer of the gilded bronze. To these illustrations Mr. Krautheimer has added a brief commentary, touching on the style and meaning of the Old and New Testament scenes represented and sketching the life of the artist -- first as a young, unknown bronze-caster competing for the Baptistery commission and then as a craftsman par excellence. -- From publisher's description",

      "abstract": "The records comprise interviews that were conducted by the Getty Art History Information Program (AHIP) and Brown University's Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship (IRIS) in 1986 and 1988.  The interviews consist of discussions with experts and researchers in the history of art and architecture.  Materials include bound transcripts of the majority of the interviews as well as some of the original sound recordings. In 1986 interviews were conducted with art historians as part of a nine-month study that examined research concerns and practices as a basis for discovering what kinds of automated tools and networked resources would enhance their scholarly work. The study resulted in the text Object, image, inquiry: the art historian at work by Elizabeth Bakewell, William O. Beeman, and Carol McMichael Reese (Getty Art History Information Program).  Bakewell (Social Science Research Analyst in the Office of Program Analysis at IRIS), Beeman (Director of the IRIS Office of Program Analysis), and Marilyn Schmitt (Program Manager in charge of scholarly coordination of art historical projects at AHIP), conducted these interviews. The 1988 interviews were conducted with architectural historians as a postscript to the earlier interviews. In contrast to the more general investigation that characterized the 1986 interviews, the purpose of this second round of interviews was to examine research practice in a specialized area of art history. The 1988 interviews were conducted by Marilyn Schmitt, Carol McMichael Reese (Research Consultant, AHIP), and Deborah N. Wilde (Research Associate, AHIP). ",

The archive reflects Steinberg's career as an art critic, lecturer and teacher from ca. 1945-ca.1996. The research notes and course notebooks give a clear picture of Steinberg's fields of interest, as well as his association with many distinguished art historians. Included are Steinberg's unpublished research on Borromini, his work on Rodin and Titian in the form of notes, photographs, lectures in typescript with notes; a few essays by others; his dissertation on Borromini, and professional correspondence such as with Rudolf Wittkower about Borromini. Correspondence about Steinberg's lecture series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and elsewhere includes letters from scholars such as Gerson Cohen, Rene d'Harnoncourt, John Canaday, Margaret Scolari Barr, Andre\u0301 Chastel, Julius Held, H.S. Janson, Irving Lavin, Annette Michelson and Phil Leider. Also, there is correspondence with art critic Hilton Kramer about Steinberg's column in the magazine Arts; articles and letters about his essay on Jasper Johns and lecture \"Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion,\" and reviews and versions of several essays from Steinberg's book Other criteria. The Papers also contain research notes, illustrations and several chapters for his abandoned dissertation \"Afterlife of Romanesque.\" Includes notebooks, many with photographs and illustrations, for courses Steinberg took when he attended the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU from 1950-1963. Professors include Harry Bober, Robert Goldwater, Ernst Kitzinger, Richard Krautheimer, Karl Lehmann, Wolfgang Lotz, Bates Lowry, Erwin Panofsky, Alfred Salmony, Charles Sterling and Herbert Weissberger.

The collection documents Keller's academic and scholarly career and provides a view of art history scholarship and pedagogy during a formative period in the discipline. Extensive, carefully composed and detailed course and lecture notes provide a precise record of Keller's teaching methods and illustrate his generalist approach. Topics cover painting, sculpture, architecture, and urbanism from the Early Christian and Byzantine periods through Impressionism. His scholarship and teaching are further documented in research notes and manuscripts, as well as in correspondence with other art historians.
